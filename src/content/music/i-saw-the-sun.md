## Lyrics

### Verse 1
Can't you see<br/>
Misery<br/>
Has engulfed our sanity<br/>
Now we laugh, now we cry<br/>
As we bow our heads and die

Hope is dead<br/>
Or so it's said<br/>
But I say we're mislead<br/>
Taking tainted meds<br/>
Hearing voices in our heads

### Chorus

I saw the sun<br/>
I saw the sun<br/>
Have you seen the sun?

Come on and run<br/>
The world is changing

(Repeat)

### Verse 2

Look around<br/>
We're earth bound<br/>
In these dungeons underground

Grab your guns<br/>
Grab your swords<br/>
We'll have to fight through hoards

I won't lie<br/>
Chance is high<br/>
If you come with me you'll die

You can stay in your cells<br/>
But as for me, I've had enough of Hell

### Chorus

I saw the sun<br/>
I saw the sun<br/>
Have you seen the sun?

Come on and run<br/>
The world is changing

I saw the sun<br/>
I saw the sun<br/>
Have you seen the sun?

Come on and run<br/>

The war's begun

### Bridge

Have you seen the sun?

### Chorus

I saw the sun<br/>
I saw the sun<br/>
Have you seen the sun?

Come on and run<br/>
The world is changing

I saw the sun<br/>
I saw the sun<br/>
Have you seen the sun?

Come on and run<br/>
You're world is changing
