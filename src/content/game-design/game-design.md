# Game Design

By Christopher W. Johnson

## Definition

* What defines a game?
* A game is largely defined by the following questions:

1. What does the game reward?
2. What is the primary player activity?
3. What is the game loop?
4. How does the player interface with the game simulation?

### What does the game reward?

* A game is a system of rewards
  * And conversely, a system of punishments
* The types of criteria a game can reward largely falls into three categories, all relating to the players:

1. **Attributes** - Games can reward players for possessing particular attributes
2. **Labor** - Games can reward players for performing particular activities
3. **Circumstances** - Games can reward players for particular extrinsic circumstances

#### Attributes

* Skill-based rewards falls under this category

##### Reward Examples

* Some games reward the player for being able to think ahead
* Some games reward players for having quick reflexes
* Some games reward players for physical strength

* Some games reward players for domain knowledge, such as knowing the layout of a level or the attack patterns of a boss
  * Some scripted video games rely heavily on the player knowing what is going to happen before it happens
    * NES games were particularly fond of this design
* Some games reward players for having good short term memory
* Some games reward players for being able to juggle many activities at once

#### Labor



#### Circumstances

##### Reward Examples

* The most common circumstance games reward players for is chance



## Genre

* Genres are recipesâ€”not recipes for entire products, but for product foundations
*  A good foundation cannot consist of any random collection of elements
* There may be an infinite number of good combinations, but for every good combination there is a hundred bad combinations
* It takes a staggering amount of trial and error to discover a new viable recipe
* It is most cost effective to use existing recipes
* Recipe discovery cost can be tempered by making minor alterations to an established recipe
  * The discovery cost only extends to the degree in which the recipe is altered
  * The discovery cost is exponential to the degree of deviation
