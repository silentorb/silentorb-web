# Scoping and Design

## Overview

* In general, processes are more efficient when they are arranged in a pipeline of batched operations
* That principle equally applies to creative processes
* When designing a product with a significant amount of unknowns it is good to separate information gathering from information refinement
* With such a division, Scoping is the information gathering phase and Design is the information refinement phase

## Scoping

### Friction Free

* A good scoping process creates minimal friction for capturing information
  * Scoping should be optimized for writing, not reading
* Organizing captured scoping information is not a priority
  * With repeated scoping the process can be gradually refined and more structure added without increasing friction
* After scoping is finished the collective scoping documents can act as a long-term archive
  * The information in this archive may rarely be needed, and querying it may require some rummaging and interpretation, but the information is there when needed

### Scoping Composition

* Depending on the nature of the product being designed, scoping commonly contains some or all of the following elements:
  * Notes
  * Brainstorming
  * Existing reference samples
  * Links to external resources

## Design

### Transition

* Ideally Design doesnâ€™t begin until Scoping has finished
* Often circumstances do not permit such separation and the two phases overlap
* When there is overlap between Scoping and Design it is good to treat them as separate contexts, consciously switching back and forth between Scoping mode and Design mode

### Channeling

* The output of Scoping is the primary input for Design
* Design takes raw scoping information and refines it into well organized and easy-to-use documentation
* It can be useful for individual elements of design documents to link to scoping artifacts so that design decisions can be traced back to their motivation origins
