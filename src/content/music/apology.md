## Lyrics

By Christopher W. Johnson

### Verse 1

Go<br/>
Ignore the signs<br/>
Stop your ears, shut your eyes<br/>
To the divine<br/>

Claim<br/>
You have no soul<br/>
While your soul tries to fill<br/>
A God-shaped hole<br/>

### Bridge 1

You say "uncouth untruth<br/>
Show me the proof<br/>
None of us have even seen God"<br/>

### Chorus 1

Love grows<br/>
Overflows<br/>
Saves souls from undertows<br/>
That's what you see when you see God<br/>

Despair<br/>
Endless care<br/>
Discontent with everywhere<br/>
That's what you get without God<br/>

That is the difference of God

All I really want<br/>
Is God<br/>

## Verse 2

Fain<br/>
A heart of gold<br/>
When we're born into sin<br/>
A thousandfold<br/>

Deign<br/>
To study church<br/>
Let the mud and tomes of fools<br/>
Be all you search<br/>

### Bridge 2

You say "two-faced<br/>
Disgrace<br/>
Look at the past<br/>
The church has only defamed your God"

### Chorus 2

Those wolves<br/>
Sheep's clothes<br/>
Hell's leaven in the loaves<br/>
Tryin' to fashion a new god<br/>

Past tense<br/>
Penitence<br/>
Straw men for your militance<br/>
None of those really knew God

It's time you met the children of God

All you really need<br/>
Is God
