# Vision

## Vision and Strategy

* Vision is sometimes confused with strategy
* Vision is where you want to go
* Strategy is how you get there
* Vision is easier than strategy
* It is easy to have a grand vision
* It is easy to have an ideal vision
* It is easy for a visionary to have confidence in a vision and neglect strategy
* Competition takes place largely on the planes of strategy, design, and executionâ€”not vision
