# Customers

## Market Research

* There is a fallacy that marketing only consists of communicating to customers
* Marketing is divided into two parts: input and output
* A bad marketer is someone who talks but doesn't listen
* Market research is essential for businesses
* It is easy for a company to neglect market research and simply guess at who the customers are, what they want, and what they need

## Market Integration

* There is a natural desire for product owners to create a product that requires the tech company to be in control over the customers
  * That desire is not healthy for either the tech company or the customer
  * That desire needs to be tamed
* It is more effective to meet customers where they are at, creating a product that helps them in their own backyard
* It is less effective to build a field of dreams that requires customers to leave their world and reside in yours in order for their needs to be met
