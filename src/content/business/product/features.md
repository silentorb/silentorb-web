# Product Features

## Minimal Viable Product

>  "My boxer is the best boxer in the world!  He can beat anyone in the ring!  All he needs is a club.  And maybe a gun.  And the opponent needs his hands tied behind his back.  With just those features, my boxer can beat anyone!" - Unsuccesful visionary

* The first version of a product (V1) needs to be an MVP (Minimally Viable Product)
* A 100-feature MVP that is useless as long as it only has 99% of those features is a bad product
* A good system is one that is useful when it is small and can seamlessly grow larger
* A good product idea is one that is useful with relatively few features
* A premature focus on supporting features is often a sign of a bad foundation
* Adding a non-essential feature to a release will not make that feature arrive sooner, it will delay the essential features
* Sometimes premature non-essential features are motivated by a reliance on spectacular product unveilings
  * First impressions are overrated
  * Most corporations had humble beginnings and slow starts
  * Spectacular unveilings work better when an established business with an established product line is releasing a new product

## Focus

* > Each tool should do one thing and do it well - the Unix Philosophy

* There are two ditches on either side of the road: trying to do too little and trying to do too much
  * Software products rarely fall into the ditch of trying to do too little
* As a company grows larger, it can afford to diversify more, but that diversification needs to be split into multiple products created by multiple teams
  * If the domains continue to become more diverse, the corporation will need to further split into multiple semi-independent child-companies with their own teams and product lines
* Avoid monolithic products
* Instead of trying to solve multiple customer problems, it is usually more efficient to create a product that solves one customer problem that can be used with other products which solve related customer problems
  * This is not the same thing as embedding third-party software, which can be useful but is not as useful
* Instead of building a sandwich, build a slice of ham
  * Then when a customer is building their own sandwich, they will say to themselves, "Now I need a slice of ham", and you will be ready to provide that slice of ham
