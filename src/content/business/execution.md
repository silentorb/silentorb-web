# Execution

## Support and Maintenance

* Things need maintenance or they decay
* Things needs support or their use will be limited
* It is easy to underestimate support and maintenance cost
* Especially in the technology industry, it is easy to think, "I will create a thing, and then walk away from that thing, and it will continue to operate and be useful independent of anyone."
  * This thinking is a fallacy
* Occasionally technologies do get a good run without maintenance, but that is the exception, not the norm, and requires both exceptional circumstances and exceptional craftsmanship
  * Even with a good run, such a technology's days are numbered without maintenance
  * Even if a technology can get by for a time without maintenance, without support that technology will not be used beyond the scope of its initial deployment
* Support and maintenance are two of the primary battlegrounds upon which tech companies compete
* If a tech company is not significantly investing in support and maintenance, it will fail

## Timelines

* The primary cause of late projects is not starting soon enough
* Reducing the length of a project either increases its cost or reduces its quality
  * Time, cost, qualityâ€”pick two
* An unrealistically short deadline results in any or all of the following:
  * Delays
  * Increased cost
  * Reduced quality
